# Robot-Path-Planning
Consider a Museum room that is patrolled by N robots at night.  At a pre-determined time,  the robots are supposed to rendezvous at a given point R in the room.  The robots move inside the room, and the room contains obstacles,  such as chairs and benches for the visitors,  paintings,  sculptures etc.  The robots are supposed to know the locations of the obstacles in the room. Implement  an A*-based  algorithm  to  compute  the  path  of  each  robot,  from  its  initial  position  to  the  given rendezvous point R.
